# 2023 Swiss Open Source Association Workshop on Generative AI

## Agenda
- History of AI
- 3 Phases of LLM
  - Pre-training
  - Supervised Fine-Tuning
  - Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
- Current debate on the future of AI

Normally, you train one big model using the 3 phases of large language models. However,
for this workshop, this will not be the case. You will train the three steps have been
unconnected for two purposes:
1. The main purpose is for you to understand the different phases without expectation of actually
training the model. The model training takes quite a lot of resources.
2. If you do not manage to finish one of the phases then it does not impede you learning
the next phase.
